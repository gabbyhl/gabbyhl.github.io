## Background and Project Goals

- I completed this semester (~ three month) long project as part of a course in Pervasive Interaction Design, taught by Stephanie Brenton, at the University of Michigan School of Information (UMSI) during my masters program.
-  Our mission: **Explore the possiblities of interaction design in ubiquitous computing by designing and prototyping an Internet of Things device.**


### Intial Ideation

<div class="two_column grid grid-cols-1 gap-y-5 md:gap-x-5 md:grid-cols-2">

<div class="grid_item px-5 md:col-span-1">

- Before our first meeting each group member independently ideated on different domains according to our own preferences and access to users for reseach. Among the ideation methods utilized were the 10x10 Matrix method and inspiration from existing product trends and social media. We then voted on which topics interested us.

From our ideation process, we chose to explore **cooking/the kitchen** for our project. We chose **young professionals** as our target audience to begin our research because we were easily able to recruit that demographic, (given this was a class project we did not have a budget to pay participants).

We also identified possible domains within the kitchen we could explore: the storage of food, addressing health needs and/or dietary restrictions in the kitchen, and learning new recipes/cooking skills.

## Exploratory Reserach

**Research Questions:**
1. What level of cooking guidance are young professionals willing to accept? What processes do they want automated vs. something they do themselves?
2. What are the current barriers to young professinals' cooking?
3. When do young professinals feel like they "own" the output of a meal?
4. How do young professionals choose what to cook? What impact do flavors have on mood?

### Methods

**Informal Contextual Inquiry**: Each team member observed a participant (or in some cases, more than one participant working together) cook a meal. We asked probing questions to understand their thoughts and behavior.

- **Why this method:** Learn more about the ways young professinals cook thought field obeservation. Identify possible places for novel machine intervention.

- **Outcome:**
Narrowed our scope to

Participants reported "winging it". Recipes were consulted for technique guidance or as a starting point for ingredients. Participants were the

**Survey:** 20 question survey– 18 multiple choice and 2 short answer.

- **Why this method:** Gain data on self reported coking behaviors and preferences–
    How often do people cook?
    What kitchen tools do they use?
    How skilled at cooking do they consider themselves?
