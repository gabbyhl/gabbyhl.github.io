## ‚è±Ô∏è Tldr;
I designed and implemented a research study evaluating the new **Duolingo Avatars** feature, with the goal of **increasing adoption** among users.

### Biggest Takeaways

 -  Prioritize creating more expressions (both neutral and fun) over creating a granular builder that lets users customize all features individually.

 -  Focus first on assets that let users express personality and demonstrate their interests.

## Background

![Screenshot featuring white text that reads Become a Dulingo character with our new avatars, below the text there is a cartoon character depiction of a person with long brown hair, a mustache and a gray shirt](/avatars_blog_heading.png "Duolingo Blog Post Introducing Avatars")

As a UX Research intern I was embedded on the connection team, within the Growth org. Connections works to grow the use of the social features on the app. My largest project was focused on **increasing adoption** of the new Duolingo Avatars feature, which allows users to create a cartoon version of themselves in the style of the Duolingo branded characters, and use that as their profile picture instead of an uploaded photo. I was tasked with **making recommendations for new iterations of the feature.**


The version of the avatar feature that became available to the public in the first few weeks of my internship was very basic. UX research before the release had been minimal.

  - _DEI audit from external consultant_


### Focus on learning
Most of the projects the Duolingo connections team works on must balance the integration of social features, which are a lever for new users and retention, with the focus of Duolingo: learning. **Social features must support learning, not distract from it.**

From a UXR perspective this means it was important to determine **how users understood avatars as fitting (or not fitting) into their overall Duolingo experience, particularly the learning experience.** E.g Did they find them valuable? Were they feel extraneous or distracting?

### Research Goals and Reserach Questions

- **Inform the strategic direction of avatar iterations/optimizations** (avatar builder assets, avatar uses in app, etc.)

- **Identify barriers, such as usability issues, users face in the adoption of an avatar**

</div>

### Initial Research Questions:
- What are the pain points of the current avatar builder experience?
- What motivates users to create an avatar?
- Why don't users adopt an avatar?
- What future iterations have the potential to most excite or delight
users?


At first, _identifying elements to add to the builder was explicitly not a stakeholder priority._ My research goal was to identify any issues in the user flow of the avatar builder. However, results from my intiial pilot research indicated that there weren't any large usability issues and feedback from senior leadership on the feature was that it needed to have more options. So the goal of my research **shifted from usability issues and barriers of use to understanding what users really want in an avatar builder.**

### Constraints

Even at the beginning of the design process, there was a question about how many options our users would want to be able to pick from in an avatar builder. How many categories? How many options per category? The thinking was that the builder needed to have enough options for people to express themselves, but we also didn‚Äôt want the builder to be too overwhelming. After the launch of the MVP it we hypthesized that lack of options was a much bigger concern for users than too many options.

However, design and development of the next iteration of the feature faced a major constraint‚Äì the avatars project was a collaboration between the illustration team and designers and software engineers. **As the illustration team works on many projects at once for teams across Duolingo, they had a limited ammunt of time they could give to avatar project.**

To inform the strategy for future iterations of the builder, my recommendations would have to answer:
- **What are the highest impact changes we can make to the avatar feature?**
- **Where should the illustration team use their limited bandwidth?**

## Methods
- **Pilot Study: Analysis of data from Fullstory:**

    I started the project looking to determine if there were any usability issues in the builder or other barriers to setting an avatar that could be easily addressed. Along with a looking at the behavior of 15 users who opened the builder but did not set an avatar, I also reviewed initial reddit comments abut the feature and comments about avatars that were sent to the Duolingo help center.

    **Outcome: No glaring usability issues- switch research focus to users' wants from and understandings of avatar builder.**

- **60 Minute User interviews:**

     I chose to do user interviews where I observed the participant going through the process of the creating an avatar and asked them talk aloud about the what they were thinking during the process. Interviews were divided into four parts:

    1. Duolingo use and past experience with avatars
    2. Observation of current avatar experience
    3. Concept testing: future builder iterations
    4. Concept testing: future uses of avatars in the app

    **Outcome: Insights and recommendations from this work influenced future strategy for avatars**


## Analysis
- **Affinity analysis (Figma and Reduct)**

  I used a modified affinity analysis, conducted on Figjam, to identify major themes in the interview data.

- **Code interviews in reduct and highlight key examples for stakeholders**

  I also used reduct to code the interview transcripts by theme and cut together video examples of these themes to present to stakeholders.

## üí° Key Insights

1. Many learners said their goal in the builder was to convey their personality and interests. A "recognizable" avatar does not necessarily mean a realistic depiction of yourself. **In place of an avatar that "accurately" depicts someone's features, an avatar that conveys personality can still fulfill the goal of self-expression.**

2. **Expressions were the source of the most delight in the current builder experience.** They emphasize the humor and "quirkiness" that the Duolingo brand is known for and they let learners convey personality.

3. In less built out categories, learners expected more choice. Facial hair, body types, clothing, and glasses were repeatedly described as being limited.

## üí• Recommendations and Impact

<div class="grid_item rounded-md text-base-content bg-secndary px-5 py-1">

### Key Recommendations

1. **When creating more facial feature assests, prioritize creating more premade expressions (both neutral and fun) over creating a granular builder that lets users customize all features individually.** Expressions are delightful and fit in with the quirkiness of the Duolingo brand. The personality they convey could make up for a lack of granular feature customization, which would require more bandwidth from the illustration team.

2.  **For highest ROl, focus first on assets that let users express personality and demonstrate their interests.** These categories include: clothing, and accessories/items such as country flags, sports equipment, headphones, musical instruments.

###  Research Impact

  #### Design and Illustration Teams

  **My research helped the design and illustration teams identify the categories that were the biggest priorities to add to the builder.** This included body types -> the options went from 2 to 6. And facial expressions. In particular, the design team was deciding between making the builder more granular by allowing users to make their own selections for each facial feature (eyes, nose, mouth etc.) indivudally or keeping the original design which had users choose a premade expression that determined all those things.

  **My recommendation was to create more premade expressions, which is what the team ultimately did (as shown below).**

  #### Product Team
  My research helped inform the future strategy avatars‚Äìin particular the decision to move forward with building out the premade expressions and not overwhelming the user with choice by creating a granular builder that lets the user customize every facial feature individually.


  #### Marketing Team
  My data had secondary impact on the marketing team- as many of the participants in my interviews discussed the Duolingo "brand" and described the avatars as part of a "branded experience".

## ü™© Reflections and things learned

- **Be adaptable to ambiguity and changing stakeholder priorities**
  This project went through many iterations
