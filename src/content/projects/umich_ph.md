## ‚è±Ô∏è Tldr;
The University of Michigan School of Public Health Careers Office requested we **evaluate their current project management system and recommend a new system** that could be adopted by everyone in the office.

### Biggest Takeaways
- Increase communication between management and rest of office including weekly all hands meetings, and hold open discussion about reasons for adaption of new system.

## Background and Project Goals

- I completed this project during my first semester at the University of Michigan as part of a course on Contexual Inquiry and Consulting Foundations for my Masters degree.

 - The team that worked on this project was made up of myself and three other U of M students.

**About University Of Michigan School of Public Health Careers Office**

The UM School of Public Health Careers Office offers professional development and career advising to students. They meet with students individually and host virtual and in person events. They also keep track of the career outcomes for the School of Public Health alumni.

### Problem statement:

Different team members were using different platforms for project management at the Careers Office. This made it **difficult to keep track of the state of current projects to find documentation of previous work**. The team was made up of individuals from work backgrounds who used various platforms for project management in their previous roles. After joining the team, they continued using their preferred project management platform. The client saught to **move everyone to the same project management platform**.


### Research goals and client requested deliverables:
- Report of recommended project management systems including cost and features
- Recommendations for transferring the office to one universal project management software
- Avoid the disadvantages of current software

### Constraints

- üí∞ **Budget**: As a small team, a major constraint for the Careers Office in choosing a new project management software was their budget. Ultimately, our report evaluated free and premium options for all of tech software we reviewed, and we included in price as one of our evaluative criteria.

## Secondary Research

### Literature Review

- To begin our project our team conducted secondary research. Each team member chose a topic to research and wrote a summary of their findings in a report.

- I chose to examine the **academic literature around technology adaption and project management in teams**.

### Secondary Research Insights:

| **Factors related to the U-M SPH**                                                            	| **Factors related to the chosen project management system**                                  	|

| What is the necessary infrastructure to support the switch and is it/can it be put in place?  	|                                                                                              	|                                                                                      |

**Outcome: These insights influenced our research goals and questions when designing the interview protocol.**

## Contextual Interviews

- **6 semi-structured interviews with staff members**: two student interns, three full-time office staff, one manager from The UM School of Public Health Marketing team
    - Approximately 60 minutes.
    - Conducted virtually over zoom.
    - Each interviewee was asked to **share their screen while preforming work tasks** so we could observe the tools they used.

<div class="grid-item md:col-span-1 self-center">

**Analysis:**

To analyze interview data, we conducted an **affinity analysis** as a group, using miro to create an affinity map.

<div class= "text-center text-sm italic pt-0 pb-5"> Affinity map identifying the main themes of our analysis.</div></div>

</div>

Using insights from  our thematic analysis we:
- Developed a **list of features the recommended PMS would need** to have to fufill the needs of the Careers Office.
- Compared possible software options for the team based on the prescense of these features and price.
- **Indentified possible pain points** that could hinder the adoption of the new software.

<div class="bg-base-200 text-base-content px-5 py-2 my-10 rounded-md">

### Key Insights

1. Priorities change fast for the Careers Office, so any PMS must be able to communicate these changes clearly to all staff.
2. The office‚Äôs work is cyclical and tasks are often repeated. **Automation of such tasks would increase efficiency**.
3. Some team members, particularly interns, say they don‚Äôt see a significant value in using project management software for their duties.
4. Learning a new PMS is daunting. But **high turnover among interns and anticipated team growth** means new members will be regularly added to the team.
5. ‚ÄúA project management tool is just a tool‚Äù.  To benefit from switching to a universal PMS, team buy-in is needed.

## Recommendations

<div class="bg-base-200 text-base-content px-5 py-2 my-10 rounded-md">

**Software Recommendations:**

**ClickUp and Asana were the strongest options for the team**, based on office needs and some member‚Äôs previous familiarity with these products.

Other systems and software, such as Trello or use fo excel spreadsheets lacked the necessary features or were overwhelming to use.

![Screenshot of excel table comparing the features and price of Asana and Clickup‚Äìfree and premium versions. Clickup Premium fufilled the most requirements.](/UMSPH_software_table.png "Comparison of the top two project management systems")

<div class= "text-center text-sm italic pt-0 pb-5"> Comparison of the top two project management systems: Clickup and Asana.</div></div>

**Nontechnical Recommendations:**

1. Give the team an introduction to what software is being used and how to use it, and why they are using it, to ensure everyone understands what it should be used for and how it should be used.

2. **Strengthen software onboarding methods**, like creating a tutorial board for users to complete introductory tasks to further understand the software.

3. **Schedule weekly all hands meetings** to share what everyone has accomplished and to keep the team up to updates with status of all projects.

## Reflection and Things Learned

- **Turning client wants into research goals:**

The client came to us with a pretty simple ask: tell us what project management software to use. As researchers, we had break figure out what research questions and methods were best suited to answering that question. In the end, we gave the client the list of software that they asked for, but also recommendations to address the needs we identified through our contextual inquiry.
